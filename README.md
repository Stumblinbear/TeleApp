Setup:
------
```
from teleapp import TeleApp

# Reply threshold is the maximum amount of seconds in the past
# that the bot should respond to. This prevents a mass of
# messages from being posted if the bot was offline for a time
# set this to -1 if you don't want a threshold.
app = TeleApp(token=BOT_TOKEN, reply_threshold=10)

# Triggers here

app.start()
```

---------
```
from teleapp.deco.cmd import cmd, arg

# Listen to /start
@cmd('start')
def start_bot(update):
    update.sender.sendMessage('Started!')

# Listen for /echo and reply with the message sent x times
# Echo message must be wrapped in quotes
# Arguments with no default value set in the function parameters
# are required. If a default value is set, the argument is optional.
# /echo "testing message"
#        bot responds with "testing message" one time
# /echo "testing message" 4
#        bot responds with "testing message" four times
@cmd('echo')
@arg('text')
